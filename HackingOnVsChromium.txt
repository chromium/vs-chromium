Walkthrough for your first time hacking on vs-chromium.

It's pretty easy actually, but newbie guides like this (which folks rarely
consulted more than once) tends to fall out of date. So if you're following this
guide and hit trouble, please try to fix what you see -- as you (the newbie) are
a better position than anyone else to do so.

=== Prereqs
    Obtain a Professional or better edition of Visual Studio 2013. The
    Express edition does not support vs-chromium.

    Download and install the Visual Studio 2013 SDK
    This SDK enables development of IDE extensions like vs-chromium.

=== Get the code
    cd D:\src\ (or some such)
    git clone https://github.com/chromium/vs-chromium.git

=== Building and running the code.
    Open vs-chromium\src\vs-chromium.sln

    Maybe start by building everything (Debug config) via F7. If you get errors,
    try figuring out the problem and don't forget to update this guide with the
    missing prereq.

    Find the VsChromium project. This builds to the .vsix binary that is the
    extension installer.

    Find the Tests project. This builds to a VS unit test (not gtest) dll.
    These tests can be run via  the top-level Test menu in the IDE:
        [Test -> Run -> All Tests (Ctrl+R, A)]
    The results show up in the Test Explorer window:
        [Test -> Windows -> Test Explorer]
    Clicking around (and right clicking) lets you interact with failures.

    To debug the extension, set VsChromium as your start-up project and start a
    debugging session via F5. This will spin up an experimental instance of
    Visual Studio running the extension. The first launch is markedly slow as
    the profile or something is created, but subsequent launches are faster.
    You'll be able to debug the code that runs inside the visual studio project,
    but vs-chromium also spins up a server process to do file system indexing,
    and you may want to debug inside that process too. To do so:

      1. Start by setting a breakpoint in
         ServerProxyProcess.cs!AfterProxyCreated This should hit (in your
         devenv.exe process) shortly after the server process is launched.

      2. When the breakpoint is hit, do Ctrl+Alt+P to open the "attach to
         process" dialog. The server process is named VsChromium.Server.exe .
         Attach to it.

      3. Now your breakpoints in the child process will work too.
