# VsChromium

VsChromium is a Visual Studio Extension containing a collection of tools
useful for editing, navigating and debugging code.

VsChromium was originally developed to help when contributing code to the
[Chromium project](http:/www.chromium.org), but has evolved over time to become
a more general purpose extension that can be useful for any project.

Amongst other things, VsChromium offers full text search engine, a fast and
scalable alternative to the built-in "Find in Files" feature that can provide
search results in less than 0.1 seconds for 100,000+ files.

See the [Feature summary](http://chromium.github.io/vs-chromium/#feature-summary)
and [Getting started](http://chromium.github.io/vs-chromium/#getting-started)
sections for more information.
